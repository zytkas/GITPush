THE PROLOGUE
Enter Chorus
CHORUS
Two households both alike in dignity
In fair Verona where we lay our scene
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
A pair of starcrossd lovers take their life
Whose misadventurd piteous overthrows
Doth with their death bury their parents strife
The fearful passage of their deathmarkd love
And the continuance of their parents rage
Which but their childrens end nought could remove
Is now the two hours traffic of our stage
The which if you with patient ears attend
What here shall miss our toil shall strive to mend
Exit

art moved thou runnst away

I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montagues

the wall therefore I will push Montagues men from the wall and
thrust his maids to the wall

GREGORY

TYBALT
What drawn and talk of peace I hate the word
As I hate hell all Montagues and thee
Have at thee coward
They fight
Enter three or four Citizens with clubs
FIRST CITIZEN
Clubs bills and partisans Strike Beat them down
Down with the Capulets Down with the Montagues
Enter Capulet in his gown and Lady Capulet
CAPULET
What noise is this Give me my long sword ho
LADY CAPULET
A crutch a crutch Why call you for a sword
CAPULET
My sword I say Old Montague is come
And flourishes his blade in spite of me
Enter Montague and his Lady Montague
MONTAGUE
Thou villain Capulet Hold me not let me go
LADY MONTAGUE
Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe
Enter Prince Escalus with Attendants
PRINCE
Rebellious subjects enemies to peace
Profaners of this neighbourstained steel
Will they not hear What ho You men you beasts
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
With purple fountains issuing from your veins
On pain of torture from those bloody hands
Throw your mistemperd weapons to the ground
And hear the sentence of your moved prince
Three civil brawls bred of an airy word
By thee old Capulet and Montague
Have thrice disturbd the quiet of our streets
And made Veronas ancient citizens
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments
To wield old partisans in hands as old
Cankerd with peace to part your cankerd hate
If ever you disturb our streets again
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace
For this time all the rest depart away
You Capulet shall go along with me
And Montague come you this afternoon
To know our farther pleasure in this case
To old Freetown our common judgementplace
Once more on pain of death all men depart
Exeunt Prince and Attendants Capulet Lady Capulet Tybalt
Citizens and Servants
MONTAGUE
Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach
Speak nephew were you by when it began
BENVOLIO
Here were the servants of your adversary
And yours close fighting ere I did approach
I drew to part them in the instant came
The fiery Tybalt with his sword prepard
Which as he breathd defiance to my ears
He swung about his head and cut the winds
Who nothing hurt withal hissd him in scorn
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows
Came more and more and fought on part and part
Till the Prince came who parted either part
LADY MONTAGUE
O where is Romeo saw you him today
Right glad I am he was not at this fray
BENVOLIO
Madam an hour before the worshippd sun
Peerd forth the golden window of the east
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad
Where underneath the grove of sycamore
That westward rooteth from this city side
So early walking did I see your son
Towards him I made but he was ware of me
And stole into the covert of the wood
I measuring his affections by my own
Which then most sought where most might not be found
Being one too many by my weary self
Pursud my humour not pursuing his
And gladly shunnd who gladly fled from me
MONTAGUE
Many a morning hath he there been seen
With tears augmenting the fresh mornings dew
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs
But all so soon as the allcheering sun
Should in the farthest east begin to draw
The shady curtains from Auroras bed
Away from light steals home my heavy son
And private in his chamber pens himself
Shuts up his windows locks fair daylight out
And makes himself an artificial night
Black and portentous must this humour prove
Unless good counsel may the cause remove
BENVOLIO
My noble uncle do you know the cause
MONTAGUE
I neither know it nor can learn of him
BENVOLIO
Have you importund him by any means
MONTAGUE
Both by myself and many other friends
But he his own affections counsellor
Is to himselfI will not say how true
But to himself so secret and so close
So far from sounding and discovery
As is the bud bit with an envious worm
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow
We would as willingly give cure as know
Enter Romeo
BENVOLIO
See where he comes So please you step aside
Ill know his grievance or be much denied
MONTAGUE
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
To hear true shrift Come madam lets away
Exeunt Montague and Lady Montague
BENVOLIO
Good morrow cousin
ROMEO
Is the day so young
BENVOLIO
But new struck nine
ROMEO
Ay me sad hours seem long
Was that my father that went hence so fast
BENVOLIO
It was What sadness lengthens Romeos hours
ROMEO
Not having that which having makes them short
BENVOLIO
In love
ROMEO
Out
BENVOLIO
Of love
ROMEO
Out of her favour where I am in love
BENVOLIO
Alas that love so gentle in his view
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof
ROMEO
Alas that love whose view is muffled still
Should without eyes see pathways to his will
Where shall we dine O me What fray was here
Yet tell me not for I have heard it all
Heres much to do with hate but more with love
Why then O brawling love O loving hate
O anything of nothing first create
O heavy lightness serious vanity
Misshapen chaos of wellseeming forms
Feather of lead bright smoke cold fire sick health
Stillwaking sleep that is not what it is
This love feel I that feel no love in this
Dost thou not laugh
BENVOLIO
No coz I rather weep
ROMEO
Good heart at what
BENVOLIO
At thy good hearts oppression
ROMEO
Why such is loves transgression
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast
Which thou wilt propagate to have it prest
With more of thine This love that thou hast shown
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own
Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs
Being purgd a fire sparkling in lovers eyes
Being vexd a sea nourishd with lovers tears
What is it else A madness most discreet
A choking gall and a preserving sweet
Farewell my coz
Going
BENVOLIO
Soft I will go along
And if you leave me so you do me wrong
ROMEO
Tut I have lost myself I am not here
This is not Romeo hes some other where
BENVOLIO
Tell me in sadness who is that you love
ROMEO
What shall I groan and tell thee
BENVOLIO
Groan Why no but sadly tell me who
ROMEO
Bid a sick man in sadness make his will
A word ill urgd to one that is so ill
In sadness cousin I do love a woman
BENVOLIO
I aimd so near when I supposd you lovd
ROMEO
A right good markman and shes fair I love
BENVOLIO
A right fair mark fair coz is soonest hit
ROMEO
Well in that hit you miss shell not be hit
With Cupids arrow she hath Dians wit
And in strong proof of chastity well armd
From loves weak childish bow she lives uncharmd
She will not stay the siege of loving terms
Nor bide thencounter of assailing eyes
Nor ope her lap to saintseducing gold
O shes rich in beauty only poor
That when she dies with beauty dies her store
BENVOLIO
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste
ROMEO
She hath and in that sparing makes huge waste
For beauty starvd with her severity
Cuts beauty off from all posterity
She is too fair too wise wisely too fair
To merit bliss by making me despair
She hath forsworn to love and in that vow
Do I live dead that live to tell it now
BENVOLIO
Be ruld by me forget to think of her
ROMEO
O teach me how I should forget to think
BENVOLIO
By giving liberty unto thine eyes
Examine other beauties
ROMEO
Tis the way
To call hers exquisite in question more
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies brows
Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair
He that is strucken blind cannot forget
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost
Show me a mistress that is passing fair
What doth her beauty serve but as a note
Where I may read who passd that passing fair
Farewell thou canst not teach me to forget
BENVOLIO
Ill pay that doctrine or else die in debt
Exeunt
SCENE II A Street
Enter Capulet Paris and Servant
CAPULET
But Montague is bound as well as I
In penalty alike and tis not hard I think
For men so old as we to keep the peace
PARIS
Of honourable reckoning are you both
And pity tis you livd at odds so long
But now my lord what say you to my suit
CAPULET
But saying oer what I have said before
My child is yet a stranger in the world
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years
Let two more summers wither in their pride
Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride
PARIS
Younger than she are happy mothers made
CAPULET
And too soon marrd are those so early made
The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she
She is the hopeful lady of my earth
But woo her gentle Paris get her heart
My will to her consent is but a part
And she agree within her scope of choice
Lies my consent and fair according voice
This night I hold an old accustomd feast
Whereto I have invited many a guest
Such as I love and you among the store
One more most welcome makes my number more
At my poor house look to behold this night
Earthtreading stars that make dark heaven light
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
When well apparelld April on the heel
Of limping winter treads even such delight
Among fresh female buds shall you this night
Inherit at my house Hear all all see
And like her most whose merit most shall be
Which on more view of many mine being one
May stand in number though in reckoning none
Come go with me Go sirrah trudge about
Through fair Verona find those persons out
Whose names are written there gives a paper and to them say
My house and welcome on their pleasure stay
Exeunt Capulet and Paris
SERVANT
Find them out whose names are written here It is written that the
shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last the
fisher with his pencil and the painter with his nets but I am sent to
find those persons whose names are here writ and can never find what
names the writing person hath here writ I must to the learned In good
time
Enter Benvolio and Romeo
BENVOLIO
Tut man one fire burns out anothers burning
One pain is lessend by anothers anguish
Turn giddy and be holp by backward turning
One desperate grief cures with anothers languish
Take thou some new infection to thy eye
And the rank poison of the old will die
ROMEO
Your plantain leaf is excellent for that
BENVOLIO
For what I pray thee
ROMEO
For your broken shin
BENVOLIO
Why Romeo art thou mad
ROMEO
Not mad but bound more than a madman is
Shut up in prison kept without my food
Whippd and tormented andGodden good fellow
SERVANT

cup of wine Rest you merry
Exit
BENVOLIO
At this same ancient feast of Capulets
Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovst
With all the admired beauties of Verona
Go thither and with unattainted eye
Compare her face with some that I shall show
And I will make thee think thy swan a crow
ROMEO
When the devout religion of mine eye
Maintains such falsehood then turn tears to fire
And these who often drownd could never die
Transparent heretics be burnt for liars
One fairer than my love The allseeing sun
Neer saw her match since first the world begun
BENVOLIO
Tut you saw her fair none else being by
Herself poisd with herself in either eye
But in that crystal scales let there be weighd
Your ladys love against some other maid
That I will show you shining at this feast
And she shall scant show well that now shows best
ROMEO
Ill go along no such sight to be shown
But to rejoice in splendour of my own
Exeunt

Thou knowest my daughters of a pretty age
NURSE

LADY CAPULET

NURSE

And yet to my teen be it spoken I have but four
She is not fourteen How long is it now
To Lammastide
LADY CAPULET
A fortnight and odd days
NURSE
Even or odd of all days in the year
Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen
Susan and sheGod rest all Christian souls
Were of an age Well Susan is with God
She was too good for me But as I said
On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen
That shall she marry I remember it well
Tis since the earthquake now eleven years
And she was weandI never shall forget it
Of all the days of the year upon that day
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug
Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall
My lord and you were then at Mantua
Nay I do bear a brain But as I said
When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
Of my dug and felt it bitter pretty fool
To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug
Shake quoth the dovehouse twas no need I trow
To bid me trudge
And since that time it is eleven years
For then she could stand alone nay by throod
She could have run and waddled all about
For even the day before she broke her brow
And then my husbandGod be with his soul
A was a merry mantook up the child
Yea quoth he dost thou fall upon thy face
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit
Wilt thou not Jule and by my holidame
The pretty wretch left crying and said Ay
To see now how a jest shall come about
I warrant and I should live a thousand years
I never should forget it Wilt thou not Jule quoth he
And pretty fool it stinted and said Ay
LADY CAPULET
Enough of this I pray thee hold thy peace
NURSE
Yes madam yet I cannot choose but laugh
To think it should leave crying and say Ay
And yet I warrant it had upon it brow
A bump as big as a young cockerels stone
A perilous knock and it cried bitterly
Yea quoth my husband fallst upon thy face
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age
Wilt thou not Jule it stinted and said Ay
JULIET
And stint thou too I pray thee Nurse say I
NURSE
Peace I have done God mark thee to his grace
Thou wast the prettiest babe that eer I nursd
And I might live to see thee married once I have my wish
LADY CAPULET
Marry that marry is the very theme
I came to talk of Tell me daughter Juliet
How stands your disposition to be married
JULIET
It is an honour that I dream not of
NURSE
An honour Were not I thine only nurse
I would say thou hadst suckd wisdom from thy teat
LADY CAPULET
Well think of marriage now younger than you
Here in Verona ladies of esteem
Are made already mothers By my count
I was your mother much upon these years
That you are now a maid Thus then in brief
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love
NURSE
A man young lady Lady such a man
As all the worldwhy hes a man of wax
LADY CAPULET
Veronas summer hath not such a flower
NURSE
Nay hes a flower in faith a very flower
LADY CAPULET
What say you can you love the gentleman
This night you shall behold him at our feast
Read oer the volume of young Paris face
And find delight writ there with beautys pen
Examine every married lineament
And see how one another lends content
And what obscurd in this fair volume lies
Find written in the margent of his eyes
This precious book of love this unbound lover
To beautify him only lacks a cover
The fish lives in the sea and tis much pride
For fair without the fair within to hide
That book in manys eyes doth share the glory
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story
So shall you share all that he doth possess
By having him making yourself no less
NURSE
No less nay bigger Women grow by men
LADY CAPULET
Speak briefly can you like of Paris love
JULIET
Ill look to like if looking liking move
But no more deep will I endart mine eye
Than your consent gives strength to make it fly

SCENE IV A Street
Enter Romeo Mercutio Benvolio with five or six Maskers
Torchbearers and others
ROMEO
What shall this speech be spoke for our excuse
Or shall we on without apology
BENVOLIO
The date is out of such prolixity
Well have no Cupid hoodwinkd with a scarf
Bearing a Tartars painted bow of lath
Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper
Nor no withoutbook prologue faintly spoke
After the prompter for our entrance
But let them measure us by what they will
Well measure them a measure and be gone
ROMEO
Give me a torch I am not for this ambling
Being but heavy I will bear the light
MERCUTIO
Nay gentle Romeo we must have you dance
ROMEO
Not I believe me you have dancing shoes
With nimble soles I have a soul of lead
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move
MERCUTIO
You are a lover borrow Cupids wings
And soar with them above a common bound
ROMEO
I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
To soar with his light feathers and so bound
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe
Under loves heavy burden do I sink
MERCUTIO
And to sink in it should you burden love
Too great oppression for a tender thing
ROMEO
Is love a tender thing It is too rough
Too rude too boisterous and it pricks like thorn
MERCUTIO
If love be rough with you be rough with love
Prick love for pricking and you beat love down
Give me a case to put my visage in Putting on a mask
A visor for a visor What care I
What curious eye doth quote deformities
Here are the beetlebrows shall blush for me
BENVOLIO
Come knock and enter and no sooner in
But every man betake him to his legs
ROMEO
A torch for me let wantons light of heart
Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels
For I am proverbd with a grandsire phrase
Ill be a candleholder and look on
The game was neer so fair and I am done
MERCUTIO
Tut duns the mouse the constables own word
If thou art dun well draw thee from the mire
Or save your reverence love wherein thou stickest
Up to the ears Come we burn daylight ho
ROMEO
Nay thats not so
MERCUTIO
I mean sir in delay
We waste our lights in vain light lights by day
Take our good meaning for our judgment sits
Five times in that ere once in our five wits
ROMEO
And we mean well in going to this mask
But tis no wit to go
MERCUTIO
Why may one ask
ROMEO
I dreamt a dream tonight
MERCUTIO
And so did I
ROMEO
Well what was yours
MERCUTIO
That dreamers often lie
ROMEO
In bed asleep while they do dream things true
MERCUTIO
O then I see Queen Mab hath been with you
She is the fairies midwife and she comes
In shape no bigger than an agatestone
On the forefinger of an alderman
Drawn with a team of little atomies
Over mens noses as they lie asleep
Her waggonspokes made of long spinners legs
The cover of the wings of grasshoppers
Her traces of the smallest spiders web
The collars of the moonshines watery beams
Her whip of crickets bone the lash of film
Her waggoner a small greycoated gnat
Not half so big as a round little worm
Prickd from the lazy finger of a maid
Her chariot is an empty hazelnut
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub
Time out o mind the fairies coachmakers
And in this state she gallops night by night
Through lovers brains and then they dream of love
Oer courtiers knees that dream on curtsies straight
Oer lawyers fingers who straight dream on fees
Oer ladies lips who straight on kisses dream
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are
Sometime she gallops oer a courtiers nose
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit
And sometime comes she with a tithepigs tail
Tickling a parsons nose as a lies asleep
Then dreams he of another benefice
Sometime she driveth oer a soldiers neck
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats
Of breaches ambuscados Spanish blades
Of healths five fathom deep and then anon
Drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes
And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
And sleeps again This is that very Mab
That plats the manes of horses in the night
And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs
Which once untangled much misfortune bodes
This is the hag when maids lie on their backs
That presses them and learns them first to bear
Making them women of good carriage
This is she
ROMEO
Peace peace Mercutio peace
Thou talkst of nothing
MERCUTIO
True I talk of dreams
Which are the children of an idle brain
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy
Which is as thin of substance as the air
And more inconstant than the wind who woos
Even now the frozen bosom of the north
And being angerd puffs away from thence
Turning his side to the dewdropping south
BENVOLIO
This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves
Supper is done and we shall come too late
ROMEO
I fear too early for my mind misgives
Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
With this nights revels and expire the term
Of a despised life closd in my breast
By some vile forfeit of untimely death
But he that hath the steerage of my course
Direct my suit On lusty gentlemen
BENVOLIO
Strike drum
Exeunt
SCENE V A Hall in Capulets House

ROMEO
What lady is that which doth enrich the hand
Of yonder knight
SERVANT
I know not sir
ROMEO
O she doth teach the torches to burn bright
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
As a rich jewel in an Ethiops ear
Beauty too rich for use for earth too dear
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
As yonder lady oer her fellows shows
The measure done Ill watch her place of stand
And touching hers make blessed my rude hand
Did my heart love till now Forswear it sight
For I neer saw true beauty till this night
TYBALT
This by his voice should be a Montague
Fetch me my rapier boy What dares the slave
Come hither coverd with an antic face
To fleer and scorn at our solemnity
Now by the stock and honour of my kin
To strike him dead I hold it not a sin
CAPULET
Why how now kinsman
Wherefore storm you so
TYBALT
Uncle this is a Montague our foe
A villain that is hither come in spite
To scorn at our solemnity this night
CAPULET
Young Romeo is it
TYBALT
Tis he that villain Romeo
CAPULET
Content thee gentle coz let him alone
A bears him like a portly gentleman
And to say truth Verona brags of him
To be a virtuous and wellgovernd youth
I would not for the wealth of all the town
Here in my house do him disparagement
Therefore be patient take no note of him
It is my will the which if thou respect
Show a fair presence and put off these frowns
An illbeseeming semblance for a feast
TYBALT
It fits when such a villain is a guest
Ill not endure him
CAPULET
He shall be endurd
What goodman boy I say he shall go to
Am I the master here or you Go to
Youll not endure him God shall mend my soul
Youll make a mutiny among my guests
You will set cockahoop youll be the man
TYBALT
Why uncle tis a shame
CAPULET
Go to go to
You are a saucy boy Ist so indeed
This trick may chance to scathe you I know what
You must contrary me Marry tis time
Well said my heartsYou are a princox go
Be quiet orMore light more lightFor shame
Ill make you quiet What cheerly my hearts
TYBALT
Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting
I will withdraw but this intrusion shall
Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall
Exit
ROMEO
To Juliet If I profane with my unworthiest hand
This holy shrine the gentle sin is this
My lips two blushing pilgrims ready stand
To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss
JULIET
Good pilgrim you do wrong your hand too much
Which mannerly devotion shows in this
For saints have hands that pilgrims hands do touch
And palm to palm is holy palmers kiss
ROMEO
Have not saints lips and holy palmers too
JULIET
Ay pilgrim lips that they must use in prayer
ROMEO
O then dear saint let lips do what hands do
They pray grant thou lest faith turn to despair
JULIET
Saints do not move though grant for prayers sake
ROMEO
Then move not while my prayers effect I take
Thus from my lips by thine my sin is purgd
Kissing her
JULIET
Then have my lips the sin that they have took
ROMEO
Sin from my lips O trespass sweetly urgd
Give me my sin again
JULIET
You kiss by the book
NURSE
Madam your mother craves a word with you

O dear account My life is my foes debt
BENVOLIO

Too early seen unknown and known too late
Prodigious birth of love it is to me
That I must love a loathed enemy
NURSE

Of one I dancd withal
One calls within Juliet
NURSE
Anon anon

ACT II
Enter Chorus
CHORUS
Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie
And young affection gapes to be his heir
That fair for which love groand for and would die
With tender Juliet matchd is now not fair
Now Romeo is belovd and loves again
Alike bewitched by the charm of looks
But to his foe supposd he must complain
And she steal loves sweet bait from fearful hooks
Being held a foe he may not have access
To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear
And she as much in love her means much less
To meet her new beloved anywhere
But passion lends them power time means to meet
Tempering extremities with extreme sweet
Exit
SCENE I An open place adjoining Capulets Garden
Enter Romeo
ROMEO
Can I go forward when my heart is here
Turn back dull earth and find thy centre out
He climbs the wall and leaps down within it
Enter Benvolio and Mercutio
BENVOLIO
Romeo My cousin Romeo Romeo
MERCUTIO
He is wise
And on my life hath stoln him home to bed
BENVOLIO
He ran this way and leapd this orchard wall
Call good Mercutio
MERCUTIO
Nay Ill conjure too
Romeo Humours Madman Passion Lover
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh
Speak but one rhyme and I am satisfied
Cry but Ah me Pronounce but Love and dove
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word
One nickname for her purblind son and heir
Young Abraham Cupid he that shot so trim
When King Cophetua lovd the beggarmaid
He heareth not he stirreth not he moveth not
The ape is dead and I must conjure him
I conjure thee by Rosalines bright eyes
By her high forehead and her scarlet lip
By her fine foot straight leg and quivering thigh
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie
That in thy likeness thou appear to us
BENVOLIO
An if he hear thee thou wilt anger him
MERCUTIO
This cannot anger him Twould anger him
To raise a spirit in his mistress circle
Of some strange nature letting it there stand
Till she had laid it and conjurd it down
That were some spite My invocation
Is fair and honest and in his mistress name
I conjure only but to raise up him
BENVOLIO
Come he hath hid himself among these trees
To be consorted with the humorous night
Blind is his love and best befits the dark
MERCUTIO
If love be blind love cannot hit the mark
Now will he sit under a medlar tree
And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
As maids call medlars when they laugh alone
O Romeo that she were O that she were
An openarse and thou a poperin pear
Romeo good night Ill to my trucklebed
This fieldbed is too cold for me to sleep
Come shall we go
BENVOLIO
Go then for tis in vain
To seek him here that means not to be found
Exeunt
SCENE II Capulets Garden
Enter Romeo
ROMEO
He jests at scars that never felt a wound
Juliet appears above at a window
But soft what light through yonder window breaks
It is the east and Juliet is the sun
Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon
Who is already sick and pale with grief
That thou her maid art far more fair than she
Be not her maid since she is envious
Her vestal livery is but sick and green
And none but fools do wear it cast it off
It is my lady O it is my love
O that she knew she were
She speaks yet she says nothing What of that
Her eye discourses I will answer it
I am too bold tis not to me she speaks
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven
Having some business do entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their spheres till they return
What if her eyes were there they in her head
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
As daylight doth a lamp her eyes in heaven
Would through the airy region stream so bright
That birds would sing and think it were not night
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand
O that I were a glove upon that hand
That I might touch that cheek
JULIET
Ay me
ROMEO
She speaks
O speak again bright angel for thou art
As glorious to this night being oer my head
As is a winged messenger of heaven
Unto the whiteupturned wondering eyes
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
When he bestrides the lazypuffing clouds
And sails upon the bosom of the air
JULIET
O Romeo Romeo wherefore art thou Romeo
Deny thy father and refuse thy name
Or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love
And Ill no longer be a Capulet
ROMEO
Aside Shall I hear more or shall I speak at this
JULIET
Tis but thy name that is my enemy
Thou art thyself though not a Montague
Whats Montague It is nor hand nor foot
Nor arm nor face nor any other part
Belonging to a man O be some other name
Whats in a name That which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet
So Romeo would were he not Romeo calld
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Without that title Romeo doff thy name
And for thy name which is no part of thee
Take all myself
ROMEO
I take thee at thy word
Call me but love and Ill be new baptisd
Henceforth I never will be Romeo
JULIET
What man art thou that thus bescreend in night
So stumblest on my counsel
ROMEO
By a name
I know not how to tell thee who I am
My name dear saint is hateful to myself
Because it is an enemy to thee
Had I it written I would tear the word
JULIET
My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
Of thy tongues utterance yet I know the sound
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague
ROMEO
Neither fair maid if either thee dislike
JULIET
How camst thou hither tell me and wherefore
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb
And the place death considering who thou art
If any of my kinsmen find thee here
ROMEO
With loves light wings did I oerperch these walls
For stony limits cannot hold love out
And what love can do that dares love attempt
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me
JULIET
If they do see thee they will murder thee
ROMEO
Alack there lies more peril in thine eye
Than twenty of their swords Look thou but sweet
And I am proof against their enmity
JULIET
I would not for the world they saw thee here
ROMEO
I have nights cloak to hide me from their eyes
And but thou love me let them find me here
My life were better ended by their hate
Than death prorogued wanting of thy love
JULIET
By whose direction foundst thou out this place
ROMEO
By love that first did prompt me to enquire
He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes
I am no pilot yet wert thou as far
As that vast shore washd with the farthest sea
I should adventure for such merchandise
JULIET
Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight
Fain would I dwell on form fain fain deny
What I have spoke but farewell compliment
Dost thou love me I know thou wilt say Ay
And I will take thy word Yet if thou swearst
Thou mayst prove false At lovers perjuries
They say Jove laughs O gentle Romeo
If thou dost love pronounce it faithfully
Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won
Ill frown and be perverse and say thee nay
So thou wilt woo But else not for the world
In truth fair Montague I am too fond
And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light
But trust me gentleman Ill prove more true
Than those that have more cunning to be strange
I should have been more strange I must confess
But that thou overheardst ere I was ware
My truelove passion therefore pardon me
And not impute this yielding to light love
Which the dark night hath so discovered
ROMEO
Lady by yonder blessed moon I vow
That tips with silver all these fruittree tops
JULIET
O swear not by the moon thinconstant moon
That monthly changes in her circled orb
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable
ROMEO
What shall I swear by
JULIET
Do not swear at all
Or if thou wilt swear by thy gracious self
Which is the god of my idolatry
And Ill believe thee
ROMEO
If my hearts dear love
JULIET
Well do not swear Although I joy in thee
I have no joy of this contract tonight
It is too rash too unadvisd too sudden
Too like the lightning which doth cease to be
Ere one can say It lightens Sweet good night
This bud of love by summers ripening breath
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet
Good night good night As sweet repose and rest
Come to thy heart as that within my breast
ROMEO
O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied
JULIET
What satisfaction canst thou have tonight
ROMEO
Thexchange of thy loves faithful vow for mine
JULIET
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it
And yet I would it were to give again
ROMEO
Wouldst thou withdraw it For what purpose love
JULIET
But to be frank and give it thee again
And yet I wish but for the thing I have
My bounty is as boundless as the sea
My love as deep the more I give to thee
The more I have for both are infinite
I hear some noise within Dear love adieu
Nurse calls within
Anon good NurseSweet Montague be true
Stay but a little I will come again
Exit
ROMEO
O blessed blessed night I am afeard
Being in night all this is but a dream
Too flattering sweet to be substantial
Enter Juliet above
JULIET
Three words dear Romeo and good night indeed
If that thy bent of love be honourable
Thy purpose marriage send me word tomorrow
By one that Ill procure to come to thee
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite
And all my fortunes at thy foot Ill lay
And follow thee my lord throughout the world
NURSE
Within Madam
JULIET
I come anon But if thou meanest not well
I do beseech thee
NURSE
Within Madam
JULIET
By and by I come
To cease thy strife and leave me to my grief
Tomorrow will I send
ROMEO
So thrive my soul
JULIET
A thousand times good night
Exit
ROMEO
A thousand times the worse to want thy light
Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books
But love from love towards school with heavy looks
Retiring slowly
Reenter Juliet above
JULIET
Hist Romeo hist O for a falconers voice
To lure this tasselgentle back again
Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
With repetition of my Romeos name
ROMEO
It is my soul that calls upon my name
How silversweet sound lovers tongues by night
Like softest music to attending ears
JULIET
Romeo
ROMEO
My nyas
JULIET
What oclock tomorrow
Shall I send to thee
ROMEO
By the hour of nine
JULIET
I will not fail Tis twenty years till then
I have forgot why I did call thee back
ROMEO
Let me stand here till thou remember it
JULIET
I shall forget to have thee still stand there
Remembering how I love thy company
ROMEO
And Ill still stay to have thee still forget
Forgetting any other home but this
JULIET
Tis almost morning I would have thee gone
And yet no farther than a wantons bird
That lets it hop a little from her hand
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves
And with a silk thread plucks it back again
So lovingjealous of his liberty
ROMEO
I would I were thy bird
JULIET
Sweet so would I
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing
Good night good night Parting is such sweet sorrow
That I shall say good night till it be morrow
Exit
ROMEO
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes peace in thy breast
Would I were sleep and peace so sweet to rest
Hence will I to my ghostly Sires cell
His help to crave and my dear hap to tell
Exit
SCENE III Friar Lawrences Cell
Enter Friar Lawrence with a basket
FRIAR LAWRENCE
The greyeyd morn smiles on the frowning night
Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light
And fleckled darkness like a drunkard reels
From forth days pathway made by Titans fiery wheels
Now ere the sun advance his burning eye
The day to cheer and nights dank dew to dry
I must upfill this osier cage of ours
With baleful weeds and preciousjuiced flowers
The earth thats natures mother is her tomb
What is her burying grave that is her womb
And from her womb children of divers kind
We sucking on her natural bosom find
Many for many virtues excellent
None but for some and yet all different
O mickle is the powerful grace that lies
In plants herbs stones and their true qualities
For naught so vile that on the earth doth live
But to the earth some special good doth give
Nor aught so good but straind from that fair use
Revolts from true birth stumbling on abuse
Virtue itself turns vice being misapplied
And vice sometimes by action dignified
Enter Romeo
Within the infant rind of this weak flower
Poison hath residence and medicine power
For this being smelt with that part cheers each part
Being tasted slays all senses with the heart
Two such opposed kings encamp them still
In man as well as herbsgrace and rude will
And where the worser is predominant
Full soon the canker death eats up that plant
ROMEO
Good morrow father
FRIAR LAWRENCE
Benedicite
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me
Young son it argues a distemperd head
So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed
Care keeps his watch in every old mans eye
And where care lodges sleep will never lie
But where unbruised youth with unstuffd brain
Doth couch his limbs there golden sleep doth reign
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
Thou art uprousd with some distemperature
Or if not so then here I hit it right
Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight
ROMEO
That last is true the sweeter rest was mine
FRIAR LAWRENCE
God pardon sin Wast thou with Rosaline
ROMEO
With Rosaline my ghostly father No
I have forgot that name and that names woe
FRIAR LAWRENCE
Thats my good son But where hast thou been then
ROMEO
Ill tell thee ere thou ask it me again
I have been feasting with mine enemy
Where on a sudden one hath wounded me
Thats by me wounded Both our remedies
Within thy help and holy physic lies
I bear no hatred blessed man for lo
My intercession likewise steads my foe
FRIAR LAWRENCE
Be plain good son and homely in thy drift
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift
ROMEO
Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set
On the fair daughter of rich Capulet
As mine on hers so hers is set on mine
And all combind save what thou must combine
By holy marriage When and where and how
We met we wood and made exchange of vow
Ill tell thee as we pass but this I pray
That thou consent to marry us today
FRIAR LAWRENCE
Holy Saint Francis What a change is here
Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear
So soon forsaken Young mens love then lies
Not truly in their hearts but in their eyes
Jesu Maria what a deal of brine
Hath washd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline
How much salt water thrown away in waste
To season love that of it doth not taste
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears
Thy old groans yet ring in mine ancient ears
Lo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
Of an old tear that is not washd off yet
If ere thou wast thyself and these woes thine
Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline
And art thou changd Pronounce this sentence then
Women may fall when theres no strength in men
ROMEO
Thou chiddst me oft for loving Rosaline
FRIAR LAWRENCE
For doting not for loving pupil mine
ROMEO
And badst me bury love
FRIAR LAWRENCE
Not in a grave
To lay one in another out to have
ROMEO
I pray thee chide me not her I love now
Doth grace for grace and love for love allow
The other did not so
FRIAR LAWRENCE
O she knew well
Thy love did read by rote that could not spell
But come young waverer come go with me
In one respect Ill thy assistant be
For this alliance may so happy prove
To turn your households rancour to pure love
ROMEO
O let us hence I stand on sudden haste
FRIAR LAWRENCE
Wisely and slow they stumble that run fast
Exeunt
SCENE IV A Street
Enter Benvolio and Mercutio
MERCUTIO
Where the devil should this Romeo be Came he not home tonight
BENVOLIO
Not to his fathers I spoke with his man
MERCUTIO
Why that same pale hardhearted wench that Rosaline torments him so
that he will sure run mad
BENVOLIO
Tybalt the kinsman to old Capulet hath sent a letter to his fathers
house
MERCUTIO
A challenge on my life
BENVOLIO
Romeo will answer it
MERCUTIO
Any man that can write may answer a letter
BENVOLIO
Nay he will answer the letters master how he dares being dared
MERCUTIO
Alas poor Romeo he is already dead stabbed with a white wenchs black
eye run through the ear with a love song the very pin of his heart
cleft with the blind bowboys buttshaft And is he a man to encounter
Tybalt
BENVOLIO
Why what is Tybalt
MERCUTIO
More than Prince of cats O hes the courageous captain of
compliments He fights as you sing pricksong keeps time distance
and proportion He rests his minim rest one two and the third in
your bosom the very butcher of a silk button a duellist a duellist
a gentleman of the very first house of the first and second cause Ah
the immortal passado the punto reverso the hay
BENVOLIO
The what
MERCUTIO
The pox of such antic lisping affecting phantasies these new tuners
of accent By Jesu a very good blade a very tall man a very good
whore Why is not this a lamentable thing grandsire that we should
be thus afflicted with these strange flies these fashionmongers
these pardonmes who stand so much on the new form that they cannot
sit at ease on the old bench O their bones their bones
Enter Romeo
BENVOLIO
Here comes Romeo here comes Romeo
MERCUTIO
Without his roe like a dried herring O flesh flesh how art thou
fishified Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in Laura to
his lady was but a kitchen wenchmarry she had a better love to
berhyme her Dido a dowdy Cleopatra a gypsy Helen and Hero hildings
and harlots Thisbe a grey eye or so but not to the purpose Signior
Romeo bonjour Theres a French salutation to your French slop You
gave us the counterfeit fairly last night
ROMEO
Good morrow to you both What counterfeit did I give you
MERCUTIO
The slip sir the slip can you not conceive
ROMEO
Pardon good Mercutio my business was great and in such a case as
mine a man may strain courtesy
MERCUTIO
Thats as much as to say such a case as yours constrains a man to bow
in the hams
ROMEO
Meaning to curtsy
MERCUTIO
Thou hast most kindly hit it
ROMEO
A most courteous exposition
MERCUTIO
Nay I am the very pink of courtesy
ROMEO
Pink for flower
MERCUTIO
Right
ROMEO
Why then is my pump well flowered
MERCUTIO
Sure wit follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out thy pump
that when the single sole of it is worn the jest may remain after the
wearing solely singular
ROMEO
O singlesoled jest solely singular for the singleness
MERCUTIO
Come between us good Benvolio my wits faint
ROMEO
Swits and spurs swits and spurs or Ill cry a match
MERCUTIO
Nay if thy wits run the wildgoose chase I am done For thou hast
more of the wildgoose in one of thy wits than I am sure I have in my
whole five Was I with you there for the goose
ROMEO
Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not there for the
goose
MERCUTIO
I will bite thee by the ear for that jest
ROMEO
Nay good goose bite not
MERCUTIO
Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting it is a most sharp sauce
ROMEO
And is it not then well served in to a sweet goose
MERCUTIO
O heres a wit of cheveril that stretches from an inch narrow to an
ell broad
ROMEO
I stretch it out for that word broad which added to the goose proves
thee far and wide a broad goose
MERCUTIO
Why is not this better now than groaning for love Now art thou
sociable now art thou Romeo now art thou what thou art by art as
well as by nature For this drivelling love is like a great natural
that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole
BENVOLIO
Stop there stop there
MERCUTIO
Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair
BENVOLIO
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large
MERCUTIO
O thou art deceived I would have made it short for I was come to the
whole depth of my tale and meant indeed to occupy the argument no
longer

very weak dealing
ROMEO Nurse commend me to thy lady and mistress I protest unto

SCENE V Capulets Garden
Enter Juliet
JULIET
The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse
In half an hour she promised to return
Perchance she cannot meet him Thats not so
O she is lame Loves heralds should be thoughts
Which ten times faster glides than the suns beams
Driving back shadows over lowering hills
Therefore do nimblepiniond doves draw love
And therefore hath the windswift Cupid wings
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
Of this days journey and from nine till twelve
Is three long hours yet she is not come
Had she affections and warm youthful blood
Shed be as swift in motion as a ball
My words would bandy her to my sweet love
And his to me
But old folks many feign as they were dead
Unwieldy slow heavy and pale as lead
Enter Nurse and Peter
O God she comes O honey Nurse what news
Hast thou met with him Send thy man away
NURSE
Peter stay at the gate
Exit Peter
JULIET
Now good sweet NurseO Lord why lookst thou sad
Though news be sad yet tell them merrily
If good thou shamst the music of sweet news
By playing it to me with so sour a face
NURSE
I am aweary give me leave awhile
Fie how my bones ache What a jaunt have I had
JULIET
I would thou hadst my bones and I thy news
Nay come I pray thee speak good good Nurse speak
NURSE
Jesu what haste Can you not stay a while Do you not see that I am
out of breath
JULIET
How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath
To say to me that thou art out of breath
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse
Is thy news good or bad Answer to that
Say either and Ill stay the circumstance
Let me be satisfied ist good or bad
NURSE
Well you have made a simple choice you know not how to choose a man
Romeo No not he Though his face be better than any mans yet his
leg excels all mens and for a hand and a foot and a body though
they be not to be talked on yet they are past compare He is not the
flower of courtesy but Ill warrant him as gentle as a lamb Go thy
ways wench serve God What have you dined at home
JULIET
No no But all this did I know before

NURSE

NURSE

Theyll be in scarlet straight at any news

To fetch a ladder by the which your love
Must climb a birds nest soon when it is dark

But you shall bear the burden soon at night

JULIET
Hie to high fortune Honest Nurse farewell
Exeunt
SCENE VI Friar Lawrences Cell
Enter Friar Lawrence and Romeo
FRIAR LAWRENCE
So smile the heavens upon this holy act
That afterhours with sorrow chide us not
ROMEO
Amen amen but come what sorrow can
It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
That one short minute gives me in her sight
Do thou but close our hands with holy words
Then lovedevouring death do what he dare
It is enough I may but call her mine
FRIAR LAWRENCE
These violent delights have violent ends
And in their triumph die like fire and powder
Which as they kiss consume The sweetest honey
Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
And in the taste confounds the appetite
Therefore love moderately long love doth so
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow
Enter Juliet
Here comes the lady O so light a foot
Will neer wear out the everlasting flint
A lover may bestride the gossamers
That idles in the wanton summer air
And yet not fall so light is vanity
JULIET
Good even to my ghostly confessor
FRIAR LAWRENCE
Romeo shall thank thee daughter for us both
JULIET
As much to him else is his thanks too much
ROMEO
Ah Juliet if the measure of thy joy
Be heapd like mine and that thy skill be more
To blazon it then sweeten with thy breath
This neighbour air and let rich musics tongue
Unfold the imagind happiness that both
Receive in either by this dear encounter
JULIET
Conceit more rich in matter than in words
Brags of his substance not of ornament
They are but beggars that can count their worth
But my true love is grown to such excess
I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth
FRIAR LAWRENCE
Come come with me and we will make short work
For by your leaves you shall not stay alone
Till holy church incorporate two in one
Exeunt
ACT III
SCENE I A public Place
Enter Mercutio Benvolio Page and Servants
BENVOLIO
I pray thee good Mercutio lets retire
The day is hot the Capulets abroad
And if we meet we shall not scape a brawl
For now these hot days is the mad blood stirring
MERCUTIO
Thou art like one of these fellows that when he enters the confines of
a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says God send me no
need of thee and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the
drawer when indeed there is no need
BENVOLIO
Am I like such a fellow
MERCUTIO
Come come thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy and as
soon moved to be moody and as soon moody to be moved
BENVOLIO
And what to
MERCUTIO
Nay an there were two such we should have none shortly for one would
kill the other Thou Why thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a
hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast Thou wilt quarrel
with a man for cracking nuts having no other reason but because thou
hast hazel eyes What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel
Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat and yet thy
head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling Thou hast
quarrelled with a man for coughing in the street because he hath
wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun Didst thou not fall
out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter with
another for tying his new shoes with an old riband And yet thou wilt
tutor me from quarrelling
BENVOLIO
And I were so apt to quarrel as thou art any man should buy the fee
simple of my life for an hour and a quarter
MERCUTIO
The fee simple O simple
Enter Tybalt and others
BENVOLIO
By my head here comes the Capulets

occasion
MERCUTIO

TYBALT
Mercutio thou consortest with Romeo
MERCUTIO
Consort What dost thou make us minstrels And thou make minstrels of
us look to hear nothing but discords Heres my fiddlestick heres
that shall make you dance Zounds consort
BENVOLIO
We talk here in the public haunt of men
Either withdraw unto some private place
And reason coldly of your grievances
Or else depart here all eyes gaze on us
MERCUTIO
Mens eyes were made to look and let them gaze
I will not budge for no mans pleasure I
Enter Romeo
TYBALT
Well peace be with you sir here comes my man
MERCUTIO
But Ill be hanged sir if he wear your livery

TYBALT

No better term than this Thou art a villain
ROMEO
Tybalt the reason that I have to love thee
Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
To such a greeting Villain am I none
Therefore farewell I see thou knowst me not
TYBALT
Boy this shall not excuse the injuries
That thou hast done me therefore turn and draw
ROMEO
I do protest I never injurd thee
But love thee better than thou canst devise
Till thou shalt know the reason of my love
And so good Capulet which name I tender
As dearly as mine own be satisfied
MERCUTIO
O calm dishonourable vile submission
Draws Alla stoccata carries it away
Tybalt you ratcatcher will you walk
TYBALT
What wouldst thou have with me
MERCUTIO
Good King of Cats nothing but one of your nine lives that I mean to
make bold withal and as you shall use me hereafter drybeat the rest
of the eight Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears
Make haste lest mine be about your ears ere it be out

grave man I am peppered I warrant for this world A plague o both

Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio
ROMEO
This gentleman the Princes near ally
My very friend hath got his mortal hurt
In my behalf my reputation staind
With Tybalts slanderTybalt that an hour
Hath been my cousin O sweet Juliet
Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
And in my temper softend valours steel
Reenter Benvolio
BENVOLIO
O Romeo Romeo brave Mercutios dead
That gallant spirit hath aspird the clouds
Which too untimely here did scorn the earth
ROMEO
This days black fate on mo days doth depend
This but begins the woe others must end
Reenter Tybalt
BENVOLIO
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again
ROMEO
Again in triumph and Mercutio slain
Away to heaven respective lenity
And fireeyd fury be my conduct now
Now Tybalt take the villain back again
That late thou gavst me for Mercutios soul
Is but a little way above our heads
Staying for thine to keep him company
Either thou or I or both must go with him
TYBALT
Thou wretched boy that didst consort him here
Shalt with him hence
ROMEO
This shall determine that
They fight Tybalt falls
BENVOLIO

Exit Romeo
Enter Citizens
FIRST CITIZEN

BENVOLIO
There lies that Tybalt
FIRST CITIZEN
Up sir go with me
I charge thee in the Princes name obey
Enter Prince attended Montague Capulet their Wives and others
PRINCE
Where are the vile beginners of this fray
BENVOLIO
O noble Prince I can discover all
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl
There lies the man slain by young Romeo
That slew thy kinsman brave Mercutio
LADY CAPULET
Tybalt my cousin O my brothers child
O Prince O husband O the blood is spilld
Of my dear kinsman Prince as thou art true
For blood of ours shed blood of Montague
O cousin cousin
PRINCE
Benvolio who began this bloody fray
BENVOLIO
Tybalt here slain whom Romeos hand did slay
Romeo that spoke him fair bid him bethink
How nice the quarrel was and urgd withal
Your high displeasure All this uttered
With gentle breath calm look knees humbly bowd
Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
Of Tybalt deaf to peace but that he tilts
With piercing steel at bold Mercutios breast
Who all as hot turns deadly point to point
And with a martial scorn with one hand beats
Cold death aside and with the other sends
It back to Tybalt whose dexterity
Retorts it Romeo he cries aloud
Hold friends Friends part and swifter than his tongue
His agile arm beats down their fatal points
And twixt them rushes underneath whose arm
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
Of stout Mercutio and then Tybalt fled
But by and by comes back to Romeo
Who had but newly entertaind revenge
And tot they go like lightning for ere I
Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain
And as he fell did Romeo turn and fly
This is the truth or let Benvolio die
LADY CAPULET
He is a kinsman to the Montague
Affection makes him false he speaks not true
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife
And all those twenty could but kill one life
I beg for justice which thou Prince must give
Romeo slew Tybalt Romeo must not live
PRINCE
Romeo slew him he slew Mercutio
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe
MONTAGUE
Not Romeo Prince he was Mercutios friend
His fault concludes but what the law should end
The life of Tybalt
PRINCE
And for that offence
Immediately we do exile him hence
I have an interest in your hates proceeding
My blood for your rude brawls doth lie ableeding
But Ill amerce you with so strong a fine
That you shall all repent the loss of mine
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses
Therefore use none Let Romeo hence in haste
Else when he is found that hour is his last
Bear hence this body and attend our will
Mercy but murders pardoning those that kill
Exeunt
SCENE II A Room in Capulets House
Enter Juliet
JULIET
Gallop apace you fieryfooted steeds
Towards Phoebus lodging Such a waggoner
As Phaeton would whip you to the west
And bring in cloudy night immediately
Spread thy close curtain loveperforming night
That runaways eyes may wink and Romeo
Leap to these arms untalkd of and unseen
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
By their own beauties or if love be blind
It best agrees with night Come civil night
Thou sobersuited matron all in black
And learn me how to lose a winning match
Playd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods
Hood my unmannd blood bating in my cheeks
With thy black mantle till strange love grow bold
Think true love acted simple modesty
Come night come Romeo come thou day in night
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
Whiter than new snow upon a ravens back
Come gentle night come loving blackbrowd night
Give me my Romeo and when I shall die
Take him and cut him out in little stars
And he will make the face of heaven so fine
That all the world will be in love with night
And pay no worship to the garish sun
O I have bought the mansion of a love
But not possessd it and though I am sold
Not yet enjoyd So tedious is this day
As is the night before some festival
To an impatient child that hath new robes
And may not wear them O here comes my Nurse
And she brings news and every tongue that speaks
But Romeos name speaks heavenly eloquence
Enter Nurse with cords
Now Nurse what news What hast thou there
The cords that Romeo bid thee fetch
NURSE
Ay ay the cords
Throws them down
JULIET
Ay me what news Why dost thou wring thy hands
NURSE
Ah welladay hes dead hes dead hes dead
We are undone lady we are undone
Alack the day hes gone hes killd hes dead
JULIET
Can heaven be so envious
NURSE
Romeo can
Though heaven cannot O Romeo Romeo
Who ever would have thought it Romeo
JULIET
What devil art thou that dost torment me thus
This torture should be roard in dismal hell
Hath Romeo slain himself Say thou but Ay
And that bare vowel I shall poison more
Than the deathdarting eye of cockatrice
I am not I if there be such an I
Or those eyes shut that make thee answer Ay
If he be slain say Ay or if not No
Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe
NURSE
I saw the wound I saw it with mine eyes
God save the markhere on his manly breast
A piteous corse a bloody piteous corse
Pale pale as ashes all bedaubd in blood
All in goreblood I swounded at the sight
JULIET
O break my heart Poor bankrout break at once
To prison eyes neer look on liberty
Vile earth to earth resign end motion here
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier
NURSE
O Tybalt Tybalt the best friend I had
O courteous Tybalt honest gentleman
That ever I should live to see thee dead
JULIET
What storm is this that blows so contrary
Is Romeo slaughterd and is Tybalt dead
My dearest cousin and my dearer lord
Then dreadful trumpet sound the general doom
For who is living if those two are gone
NURSE
Tybalt is gone and Romeo banished
Romeo that killd him he is banished
JULIET
O God Did Romeos hand shed Tybalts blood
NURSE
It did it did alas the day it did
JULIET
O serpent heart hid with a flowering face
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave
Beautiful tyrant fiend angelical
Dovefeatherd raven wolvishravening lamb
Despised substance of divinest show
Just opposite to what thou justly seemst
A damned saint an honourable villain
O nature what hadst thou to do in hell
When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh
Was ever book containing such vile matter
So fairly bound O that deceit should dwell
In such a gorgeous palace
NURSE
Theres no trust
No faith no honesty in men All perjurd
All forsworn all naught all dissemblers
Ah wheres my man Give me some aqua vitae
These griefs these woes these sorrows make me old
Shame come to Romeo
JULIET
Blisterd be thy tongue
For such a wish He was not born to shame
Upon his brow shame is ashamd to sit
For tis a throne where honour may be crownd
Sole monarch of the universal earth
O what a beast was I to chide at him
NURSE
Will you speak well of him that killd your cousin
JULIET
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband
Ah poor my lord what tongue shall smooth thy name
When I thy threehours wife have mangled it
But wherefore villain didst thou kill my cousin
That villain cousin would have killd my husband
Back foolish tears back to your native spring
Your tributary drops belong to woe
Which you mistaking offer up to joy
My husband lives that Tybalt would have slain
And Tybalts dead that would have slain my husband
All this is comfort wherefore weep I then
Some word there was worser than Tybalts death
That murderd me I would forget it fain
But O it presses to my memory
Like damned guilty deeds to sinners minds
Tybalt is dead and Romeo banished
That banished that one word banished
Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts Tybalts death
Was woe enough if it had ended there
Or if sour woe delights in fellowship
And needly will be rankd with other griefs
Why followd not when she said Tybalts dead
Thy father or thy mother nay or both
Which modern lamentation might have movd
But with a rearward following Tybalts death
Romeo is banishedto speak that word
Is father mother Tybalt Romeo Juliet
All slain all dead Romeo is banished
There is no end no limit measure bound
In that words death no words can that woe sound
Where is my father and my mother Nurse
NURSE
Weeping and wailing over Tybalts corse
Will you go to them I will bring you thither
JULIET
Wash they his wounds with tears Mine shall be spent
When theirs are dry for Romeos banishment
Take up those cords Poor ropes you are beguild
Both you and I for Romeo is exild
He made you for a highway to my bed
But I a maid die maidenwidowed
Come cords come Nurse Ill to my wedding bed
And death not Romeo take my maidenhead
NURSE
Hie to your chamber Ill find Romeo
To comfort you I wot well where he is
Hark ye your Romeo will be here at night
Ill to him he is hid at Lawrence cell
JULIET
O find him give this ring to my true knight
And bid him come to take his last farewell
Exeunt
SCENE III Friar Lawrences cell
Enter Friar Lawrence
FRIAR LAWRENCE
Romeo come forth come forth thou fearful man
Affliction is enanmourd of thy parts
And thou art wedded to calamity
Enter Romeo
ROMEO
Father what news What is the Princes doom
What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand
That I yet know not
FRIAR LAWRENCE
Too familiar
Is my dear son with such sour company
I bring thee tidings of the Princes doom
ROMEO
What less than doomsday is the Princes doom
FRIAR LAWRENCE
A gentler judgment vanishd from his lips
Not bodys death but bodys banishment
ROMEO
Ha banishment Be merciful say death
For exile hath more terror in his look
Much more than death Do not say banishment
FRIAR LAWRENCE
Hence from Verona art thou banished
Be patient for the world is broad and wide
ROMEO
There is no world without Verona walls
But purgatory torture hell itself
Hence banished is banishd from the world
And worlds exile is death Then banished
Is death mistermd Calling death banished
Thou cuttst my head off with a golden axe
And smilest upon the stroke that murders me
FRIAR LAWRENCE
O deadly sin O rude unthankfulness
Thy fault our law calls death but the kind Prince
Taking thy part hath brushd aside the law
And turnd that black word death to banishment
This is dear mercy and thou seest it not
ROMEO
Tis torture and not mercy Heaven is here
Where Juliet lives and every cat and dog
And little mouse every unworthy thing
Live here in heaven and may look on her
But Romeo may not More validity
More honourable state more courtship lives
In carrion flies than Romeo They may seize
On the white wonder of dear Juliets hand
And steal immortal blessing from her lips
Who even in pure and vestal modesty
Still blush as thinking their own kisses sin
But Romeo may not he is banished
This may flies do when I from this must fly
They are free men but I am banished
And sayst thou yet that exile is not death
Hadst thou no poison mixd no sharpground knife
No sudden mean of death though neer so mean
But banished to kill me Banished
O Friar the damned use that word in hell
Howling attends it How hast thou the heart
Being a divine a ghostly confessor
A sinabsolver and my friend professd
To mangle me with that word banished
FRIAR LAWRENCE
Thou fond mad man hear me speak a little
ROMEO
O thou wilt speak again of banishment
FRIAR LAWRENCE
Ill give thee armour to keep off that word
Adversitys sweet milk philosophy
To comfort thee though thou art banished
ROMEO
Yet banished Hang up philosophy
Unless philosophy can make a Juliet
Displant a town reverse a Princes doom
It helps not it prevails not talk no more
FRIAR LAWRENCE
O then I see that mad men have no ears
ROMEO
How should they when that wise men have no eyes
FRIAR LAWRENCE
Let me dispute with thee of thy estate
ROMEO
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel
Wert thou as young as I Juliet thy love
An hour but married Tybalt murdered
Doting like me and like me banished
Then mightst thou speak then mightst thou tear thy hair
And fall upon the ground as I do now
Taking the measure of an unmade grave
Knocking within
FRIAR LAWRENCE
Arise one knocks Good Romeo hide thyself
ROMEO
Not I unless the breath of heartsick groans
Mistlike infold me from the search of eyes
Knocking
FRIAR LAWRENCE
Hark how they knockWhos thereRomeo arise
Thou wilt be takenStay awhileStand up
Knocking
Run to my studyByandbyGods will
What simpleness is thisI come I come
Knocking
Who knocks so hard Whence come you whats your will
NURSE

FRIAR LAWRENCE
Welcome then
Enter Nurse
NURSE
O holy Friar O tell me holy Friar
Where is my ladys lord wheres Romeo
FRIAR LAWRENCE
There on the ground with his own tears made drunk
NURSE
O he is even in my mistress case
Just in her case O woeful sympathy
Piteous predicament Even so lies she
Blubbering and weeping weeping and blubbering
Stand up stand up stand and you be a man
For Juliets sake for her sake rise and stand
Why should you fall into so deep an O
ROMEO
Nurse
NURSE
Ah sir ah sir deaths the end of all
ROMEO
Spakest thou of Juliet How is it with her
Doth not she think me an old murderer
Now I have staind the childhood of our joy
With blood removd but little from her own
Where is she And how doth she And what says
My conceald lady to our cancelld love
NURSE
O she says nothing sir but weeps and weeps
And now falls on her bed and then starts up
And Tybalt calls and then on Romeo cries
And then down falls again
ROMEO
As if that name
Shot from the deadly level of a gun
Did murder her as that names cursed hand
Murderd her kinsman O tell me Friar tell me
In what vile part of this anatomy
Doth my name lodge Tell me that I may sack
The hateful mansion
Drawing his sword
FRIAR LAWRENCE
Hold thy desperate hand
Art thou a man Thy form cries out thou art
Thy tears are womanish thy wild acts denote
The unreasonable fury of a beast
Unseemly woman in a seeming man
And illbeseeming beast in seeming both
Thou hast amazd me By my holy order
I thought thy disposition better temperd
Hast thou slain Tybalt Wilt thou slay thyself
And slay thy lady that in thy life lives
By doing damned hate upon thyself
Why railst thou on thy birth the heaven and earth
Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet
In thee at once which thou at once wouldst lose
Fie fie thou shamst thy shape thy love thy wit
Which like a usurer aboundst in all
And usest none in that true use indeed
Which should bedeck thy shape thy love thy wit
Thy noble shape is but a form of wax
Digressing from the valour of a man
Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury
Killing that love which thou hast vowd to cherish
Thy wit that ornament to shape and love
Misshapen in the conduct of them both
Like powder in a skilless soldiers flask
Is set afire by thine own ignorance
And thou dismemberd with thine own defence
What rouse thee man Thy Juliet is alive
For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead
There art thou happy Tybalt would kill thee
But thou slewst Tybalt there art thou happy
The law that threatend death becomes thy friend
And turns it to exile there art thou happy
A pack of blessings light upon thy back
Happiness courts thee in her best array
But like a misshaped and sullen wench
Thou puttst up thy Fortune and thy love
Take heed take heed for such die miserable
Go get thee to thy love as was decreed
Ascend her chamber hence and comfort her
But look thou stay not till the watch be set
For then thou canst not pass to Mantua
Where thou shalt live till we can find a time
To blaze your marriage reconcile your friends
Beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back
With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
Than thou wentst forth in lamentation
Go before Nurse Commend me to thy lady
And bid her hasten all the house to bed
Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto
Romeo is coming
NURSE
O Lord I could have stayd here all the night
To hear good counsel O what learning is
My lord Ill tell my lady you will come
ROMEO
Do so and bid my sweet prepare to chide
NURSE
Here sir a ring she bid me give you sir
Hie you make haste for it grows very late
Exit
ROMEO
How well my comfort is revivd by this
FRIAR LAWRENCE
Go hence good night and here stands all your state
Either be gone before the watch be set
Or by the break of day disguisd from hence
Sojourn in Mantua Ill find out your man
And he shall signify from time to time
Every good hap to you that chances here
Give me thy hand tis late farewell good night
ROMEO
But that a joy past joy calls out on me
It were a grief so brief to part with thee
Farewell

SCENE V An open Gallery to Juliets Chamber overlooking the Garden
Enter Romeo and Juliet
JULIET
Wilt thou be gone It is not yet near day
It was the nightingale and not the lark
That piercd the fearful hollow of thine ear
Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree
Believe me love it was the nightingale
ROMEO
It was the lark the herald of the morn
No nightingale Look love what envious streaks
Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east
Nights candles are burnt out and jocund day
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops
I must be gone and live or stay and die
JULIET
Yond light is not daylight I know it I
It is some meteor that the sun exhales
To be to thee this night a torchbearer
And light thee on thy way to Mantua
Therefore stay yet thou needst not to be gone
ROMEO
Let me be taen let me be put to death
I am content so thou wilt have it so
Ill say yon grey is not the mornings eye
Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthias brow
Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads
I have more care to stay than will to go
Come death and welcome Juliet wills it so
How ist my soul Lets talk It is not day
JULIET
It is it is Hie hence be gone away
It is the lark that sings so out of tune
Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps
Some say the lark makes sweet division
This doth not so for she divideth us
Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes
O now I would they had changd voices too
Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray
Hunting thee hence with huntsup to the day
O now be gone more light and light it grows
ROMEO
More light and light more dark and dark our woes
Enter Nurse
NURSE
Madam
JULIET
Nurse
NURSE
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber
The day is broke be wary look about
Exit
JULIET
Then window let day in and let life out
ROMEO
Farewell farewell one kiss and Ill descend
Descends
JULIET
Art thou gone so Love lord ay husband friend
I must hear from thee every day in the hour
For in a minute there are many days
O by this count I shall be much in years
Ere I again behold my Romeo
ROMEO
Farewell
I will omit no opportunity
That may convey my greetings love to thee
JULIET
O thinkest thou we shall ever meet again
ROMEO
I doubt it not and all these woes shall serve
For sweet discourses in our time to come
JULIET
O God I have an illdivining soul
Methinks I see thee now thou art so low
As one dead in the bottom of a tomb
Either my eyesight fails or thou lookst pale
ROMEO
And trust me love in my eye so do you
Dry sorrow drinks our blood Adieu adieu
Exit below
JULIET
O Fortune Fortune All men call thee fickle
If thou art fickle what dost thou with him
That is renownd for faith Be fickle Fortune
For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long
But send him back
LADY CAPULET
Within Ho daughter are you up
JULIET
Who ist that calls Is it my lady mother
Is she not down so late or up so early
What unaccustomd cause procures her hither
Enter Lady Capulet
LADY CAPULET
Why how now Juliet
JULIET
Madam I am not well
LADY CAPULET
Evermore weeping for your cousins death
What wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears
And if thou couldst thou couldst not make him live
Therefore have done some grief shows much of love
But much of grief shows still some want of wit
JULIET
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss
LADY CAPULET
So shall you feel the loss but not the friend
Which you weep for
JULIET
Feeling so the loss
I cannot choose but ever weep the friend
LADY CAPULET
Well girl thou weepst not so much for his death
As that the villain lives which slaughterd him
JULIET
What villain madam
LADY CAPULET
That same villain Romeo
JULIET
Villain and he be many miles asunder
God pardon him I do with all my heart
And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart
LADY CAPULET
That is because the traitor murderer lives
JULIET
Ay madam from the reach of these my hands
Would none but I might venge my cousins death
LADY CAPULET
We will have vengeance for it fear thou not
Then weep no more Ill send to one in Mantua
Where that same banishd runagate doth live
Shall give him such an unaccustomd dram
That he shall soon keep Tybalt company
And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied
JULIET
Indeed I never shall be satisfied
With Romeo till I behold himdead
Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vexd
Madam if you could find out but a man
To bear a poison I would temper it
That Romeo should upon receipt thereof
Soon sleep in quiet O how my heart abhors
To hear him namd and cannot come to him
To wreak the love I bore my cousin
Upon his body that hath slaughterd him
LADY CAPULET
Find thou the means and Ill find such a man
But now Ill tell thee joyful tidings girl
JULIET
And joy comes well in such a needy time
What are they I beseech your ladyship
LADY CAPULET
Well well thou hast a careful father child
One who to put thee from thy heaviness
Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy
That thou expects not nor I lookd not for
JULIET
Madam in happy time what day is that
LADY CAPULET
Marry my child early next Thursday morn
The gallant young and noble gentleman
The County Paris at Saint Peters Church
Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride
JULIET
Now by Saint Peters Church and Peter too
He shall not make me there a joyful bride
I wonder at this haste that I must wed
Ere he that should be husband comes to woo
I pray you tell my lord and father madam
I will not marry yet and when I do I swear
It shall be Romeo whom you know I hate
Rather than Paris These are news indeed
LADY CAPULET
Here comes your father tell him so yourself
And see how he will take it at your hands
Enter Capulet and Nurse
CAPULET
When the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew
But for the sunset of my brothers son
It rains downright
How now A conduit girl What still in tears
Evermore showering In one little body
Thou counterfeits a bark a sea a wind
For still thy eyes which I may call the sea
Do ebb and flow with tears the bark thy body is
Sailing in this salt flood the winds thy sighs
Who raging with thy tears and they with them
Without a sudden calm will overset
Thy tempesttossed body How now wife
Have you deliverd to her our decree
LADY CAPULET
Ay sir but she will none she gives you thanks
I would the fool were married to her grave
CAPULET
Soft Take me with you take me with you wife
How will she none Doth she not give us thanks
Is she not proud Doth she not count her blest
Unworthy as she is that we have wrought
So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom
JULIET
Not proud you have but thankful that you have
Proud can I never be of what I hate
But thankful even for hate that is meant love
CAPULET
How now how now choppd logic What is this
Proud and I thank you and I thank you not
And yet not proud Mistress minion you
Thank me no thankings nor proud me no prouds
But fettle your fine joints gainst Thursday next
To go with Paris to Saint Peters Church
Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither
Out you greensickness carrion Out you baggage
You tallowface
LADY CAPULET
Fie fie What are you mad
JULIET
Good father I beseech you on my knees
Hear me with patience but to speak a word
CAPULET
Hang thee young baggage disobedient wretch
I tell thee whatget thee to church a Thursday
Or never after look me in the face
Speak not reply not do not answer me
My fingers itch Wife we scarce thought us blest
That God had lent us but this only child
But now I see this one is one too much
And that we have a curse in having her
Out on her hilding
NURSE
God in heaven bless her
You are to blame my lord to rate her so
CAPULET
And why my lady wisdom Hold your tongue
Good prudence smatter with your gossips go
NURSE
I speak no treason
CAPULET
O God ye gooden
NURSE
May not one speak
CAPULET
Peace you mumbling fool
Utter your gravity oer a gossips bowl
For here we need it not
LADY CAPULET
You are too hot
CAPULET
Gods bread it makes me mad
Day night hour ride time work play
Alone in company still my care hath been
To have her matchd and having now provided
A gentleman of noble parentage
Of fair demesnes youthful and nobly allied
Stuffd as they say with honourable parts
Proportiond as ones thought would wish a man
And then to have a wretched puling fool
A whining mammet in her fortunes tender
To answer Ill not wed I cannot love
I am too young I pray you pardon me
But and you will not wed Ill pardon you
Graze where you will you shall not house with me
Look tot think ont I do not use to jest
Thursday is near lay hand on heart advise
And you be mine Ill give you to my friend
And you be not hang beg starve die in the streets
For by my soul Ill neer acknowledge thee
Nor what is mine shall never do thee good
Trust tot bethink you Ill not be forsworn
Exit
JULIET
Is there no pity sitting in the clouds
That sees into the bottom of my grief
O sweet my mother cast me not away
Delay this marriage for a month a week
Or if you do not make the bridal bed
In that dim monument where Tybalt lies
LADY CAPULET
Talk not to me for Ill not speak a word
Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee
Exit
JULIET
O God O Nurse how shall this be prevented
My husband is on earth my faith in heaven
How shall that faith return again to earth
Unless that husband send it me from heaven
By leaving earth Comfort me counsel me
Alack alack that heaven should practise stratagems
Upon so soft a subject as myself
What sayst thou Hast thou not a word of joy
Some comfort Nurse
NURSE
Faith here it is
Romeo is banished and all the world to nothing
That he dares neer come back to challenge you
Or if he do it needs must be by stealth
Then since the case so stands as now it doth
I think it best you married with the County
O hes a lovely gentleman
Romeos a dishclout to him An eagle madam
Hath not so green so quick so fair an eye
As Paris hath Beshrew my very heart
I think you are happy in this second match
For it excels your first or if it did not
Your first is dead or twere as good he were
As living here and you no use of him
JULIET
Speakest thou from thy heart
NURSE
And from my soul too
Or else beshrew them both
JULIET
Amen
NURSE
What
JULIET
Well thou hast comforted me marvellous much
Go in and tell my lady I am gone
Having displeasd my father to Lawrence cell
To make confession and to be absolvd
NURSE
Marry I will and this is wisely done
Exit
JULIET
Ancient damnation O most wicked fiend
Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn
Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
Which she hath praisd him with above compare
So many thousand times Go counsellor
Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain
Ill to the Friar to know his remedy
If all else fail myself have power to die
Exit
ACT IV
SCENE I Friar Lawrences Cell
Enter Friar Lawrence and Paris
FRIAR LAWRENCE
On Thursday sir The time is very short
PARIS
My father Capulet will have it so
And I am nothing slow to slack his haste
FRIAR LAWRENCE
You say you do not know the ladys mind
Uneven is the course I like it not
PARIS
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalts death
And therefore have I little talkd of love
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears
Now sir her father counts it dangerous
That she do give her sorrow so much sway
And in his wisdom hastes our marriage
To stop the inundation of her tears
Which too much minded by herself alone
May be put from her by society
Now do you know the reason of this haste
FRIAR LAWRENCE
Aside I would I knew not why it should be slowd
Look sir here comes the lady toward my cell
Enter Juliet
PARIS
Happily met my lady and my wife
JULIET
That may be sir when I may be a wife
PARIS
That may be must be love on Thursday next
JULIET
What must be shall be
FRIAR LAWRENCE
Thats a certain text
PARIS
Come you to make confession to this father
JULIET
To answer that I should confess to you
PARIS
Do not deny to him that you love me
JULIET
I will confess to you that I love him
PARIS
So will ye I am sure that you love me
JULIET
If I do so it will be of more price
Being spoke behind your back than to your face
PARIS
Poor soul thy face is much abusd with tears
JULIET
The tears have got small victory by that
For it was bad enough before their spite
PARIS
Thou wrongst it more than tears with that report
JULIET
That is no slander sir which is a truth
And what I spake I spake it to my face
PARIS
Thy face is mine and thou hast slanderd it
JULIET
It may be so for it is not mine own
Are you at leisure holy father now
Or shall I come to you at evening mass
FRIAR LAWRENCE
My leisure serves me pensive daughter now
My lord we must entreat the time alone
PARIS
God shield I should disturb devotion
Juliet on Thursday early will I rouse ye
Till then adieu and keep this holy kiss
Exit
JULIET
O shut the door and when thou hast done so
Come weep with me past hope past cure past help
FRIAR LAWRENCE
O Juliet I already know thy grief
It strains me past the compass of my wits
I hear thou must and nothing may prorogue it
On Thursday next be married to this County
JULIET
Tell me not Friar that thou hearst of this
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help
Do thou but call my resolution wise
And with this knife Ill help it presently
God joind my heart and Romeos thou our hands
And ere this hand by thee to Romeos seald
Shall be the label to another deed
Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
Turn to another this shall slay them both
Therefore out of thy longexperiencd time
Give me some present counsel or behold
Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
Shall play the empire arbitrating that
Which the commission of thy years and art
Could to no issue of true honour bring
Be not so long to speak I long to die
If what thou speakst speak not of remedy
FRIAR LAWRENCE
Hold daughter I do spy a kind of hope
Which craves as desperate an execution
As that is desperate which we would prevent
If rather than to marry County Paris
Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself
Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
A thing like death to chide away this shame
That copst with death himself to scape from it
And if thou darst Ill give thee remedy
JULIET
O bid me leap rather than marry Paris
From off the battlements of yonder tower
Or walk in thievish ways or bid me lurk
Where serpents are Chain me with roaring bears
Or hide me nightly in a charnelhouse
Oercoverd quite with dead mens rattling bones
With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls
Or bid me go into a newmade grave
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud
Things that to hear them told have made me tremble
And I will do it without fear or doubt
To live an unstaind wife to my sweet love
FRIAR LAWRENCE
Hold then Go home be merry give consent
To marry Paris Wednesday is tomorrow
Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone
Let not thy Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber
Take thou this vial being then in bed
And this distilled liquor drink thou off
When presently through all thy veins shall run
A cold and drowsy humour for no pulse
Shall keep his native progress but surcease
No warmth no breath shall testify thou livest
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
To paly ashes thy eyes windows fall
Like death when he shuts up the day of life
Each part deprivd of supple government
Shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death
And in this borrowd likeness of shrunk death
Thou shalt continue two and forty hours
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep
Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes
To rouse thee from thy bed there art thou dead
Then as the manner of our country is
In thy best robes uncoverd on the bier
Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie
In the meantime against thou shalt awake
Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift
And hither shall he come and he and I
Will watch thy waking and that very night
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua
And this shall free thee from this present shame
If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
Abate thy valour in the acting it
JULIET
Give me give me O tell not me of fear
FRIAR LAWRENCE
Hold get you gone be strong and prosperous
In this resolve Ill send a friar with speed
To Mantua with my letters to thy lord
JULIET
Love give me strength and strength shall help afford
Farewell dear father

CAPULET

Where I have learnt me to repent the sin
Of disobedient opposition
To you and your behests and am enjoind
By holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here
To beg your pardon Pardon I beseech you
Henceforward I am ever ruld by you
CAPULET
Send for the County go tell him of this

And gave him what becomed love I might
Not stepping oer the bounds of modesty
CAPULET

Since this same wayward girl is so reclaimd
Exeunt
SCENE III Juliets Chamber
Enter Juliet and Nurse
JULIET
Ay those attires are best But gentle Nurse
I pray thee leave me to myself tonight
For I have need of many orisons
To move the heavens to smile upon my state
Which well thou knowst is cross and full of sin
Enter Lady Capulet
LADY CAPULET
What are you busy ho Need you my help
JULIET
No madam we have culld such necessaries
As are behoveful for our state tomorrow
So please you let me now be left alone
And let the nurse this night sit up with you
For I am sure you have your hands full all
In this so sudden business
LADY CAPULET
Good night
Get thee to bed and rest for thou hast need
Exeunt Lady Capulet and Nurse
JULIET
Farewell God knows when we shall meet again
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
That almost freezes up the heat of life
Ill call them back again to comfort me
NurseWhat should she do here
My dismal scene I needs must act alone
Come vial
What if this mixture do not work at all
Shall I be married then tomorrow morning
No No This shall forbid it Lie thou there
Laying down her dagger
What if it be a poison which the Friar
Subtly hath ministerd to have me dead
Lest in this marriage he should be dishonourd
Because he married me before to Romeo
I fear it is And yet methinks it should not
For he hath still been tried a holy man
How if when I am laid into the tomb
I wake before the time that Romeo
Come to redeem me Theres a fearful point
Shall I not then be stifled in the vault
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes
Or if I live is it not very like
The horrible conceit of death and night
Together with the terror of the place
As in a vault an ancient receptacle
Where for this many hundred years the bones
Of all my buried ancestors are packd
Where bloody Tybalt yet but green in earth
Lies festering in his shroud where as they say
At some hours in the night spirits resort
Alack alack is it not like that I
So early waking what with loathsome smells
And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth
That living mortals hearing them run mad
O if I wake shall I not be distraught
Environed with all these hideous fears
And madly play with my forefathers joints
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud
And in this rage with some great kinsmans bone
As with a club dash out my desperate brains
O look methinks I see my cousins ghost
Seeking out Romeo that did spit his body
Upon a rapiers point Stay Tybalt stay
Romeo Romeo Romeo heres drink I drink to thee
Throws herself on the bed
SCENE IV Hall in Capulets House

CAPULET
Death that hath taen her hence to make me wail
Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak
Enter Friar Lawrence and Paris with Musicians
FRIAR LAWRENCE

PARIS
Have I thought long to see this mornings face
And doth it give me such a sight as this
LADY CAPULET
Accursd unhappy wretched hateful day
Most miserable hour that eer time saw
In lasting labour of his pilgrimage
But one poor one one poor and loving child
But one thing to rejoice and solace in
And cruel death hath catchd it from my sight
NURSE

To murder murder our solemnity
O child O child My soul and not my child
Dead art thou Alack my child is dead
And with my child my joys are buried
FRIAR LAWRENCE
Peace ho for shame Confusions cure lives not
In these confusions Heaven and yourself
Had part in this fair maid now heaven hath all
And all the better is it for the maid
Your part in her you could not keep from death
But heaven keeps his part in eternal life
The most you sought was her promotion
For twas your heaven she should be advancd
And weep ye now seeing she is advancd
Above the clouds as high as heaven itself
O in this love you love your child so ill
That you run mad seeing that she is well
Shes not well married that lives married long
But shes best married that dies married young
Dry up your tears and stick your rosemary
On this fair corse and as the custom is
And in her best array bear her to church
For though fond nature bids us all lament
Yet natures tears are reasons merriment
CAPULET
All things that we ordained festival
Turn from their office to black funeral
Our instruments to melancholy bells
Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change
Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse
And all things change them to the contrary
FRIAR LAWRENCE
Sir go you in and madam go with him
And go Sir Paris everyone prepare
To follow this fair corse unto her grave
The heavens do lower upon you for some ill
Move them no more by crossing their high will

ACT V
SCENE I Mantua A Street
Enter Romeo
ROMEO
If I may trust the flattering eye of sleep
My dreams presage some joyful news at hand
My bosoms lord sits lightly in his throne
And all this day an unaccustomd spirit
Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead
Strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think
And breathd such life with kisses in my lips
That I revivd and was an emperor
Ah me how sweet is love itself possessd
When but loves shadows are so rich in joy
Enter Balthasar
News from Verona How now Balthasar
Dost thou not bring me letters from the Friar
How doth my lady Is my father well
How fares my Juliet That I ask again
For nothing can be ill if she be well
BALTHASAR
Then she is well and nothing can be ill
Her body sleeps in Capels monument
And her immortal part with angels lives
I saw her laid low in her kindreds vault
And presently took post to tell it you
O pardon me for bringing these ill news
Since you did leave it for my office sir
ROMEO
Is it even so Then I defy you stars
Thou knowst my lodging Get me ink and paper
And hire posthorses I will hence tonight
BALTHASAR
I do beseech you sir have patience
Your looks are pale and wild and do import
Some misadventure
ROMEO
Tush thou art deceivd
Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do
Hast thou no letters to me from the Friar
BALTHASAR
No my good lord
ROMEO
No matter Get thee gone
And hire those horses Ill be with thee straight
Exit Balthasar
Well Juliet I will lie with thee tonight
Lets see for means O mischief thou art swift
To enter in the thoughts of desperate men
I do remember an apothecary
And hereabouts he dwellswhich late I noted
In tatterd weeds with overwhelming brows
Culling of simples meagre were his looks
Sharp misery had worn him to the bones
And in his needy shop a tortoise hung
An alligator stuffd and other skins
Of illshaped fishes and about his shelves
A beggarly account of empty boxes
Green earthen pots bladders and musty seeds
Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses
Were thinly scatterd to make up a show
Noting this penury to myself I said
And if a man did need a poison now
Whose sale is present death in Mantua
Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him
O this same thought did but forerun my need
And this same needy man must sell it me
As I remember this should be the house
Being holiday the beggars shop is shut
What ho Apothecary
Enter Apothecary
APOTHECARY
Who calls so loud
ROMEO
Come hither man I see that thou art poor
Hold there is forty ducats Let me have
A dram of poison such soonspeeding gear
As will disperse itself through all the veins
That the lifeweary taker may fall dead
And that the trunk may be dischargd of breath
As violently as hasty powder fird
Doth hurry from the fatal cannons womb
APOTHECARY
Such mortal drugs I have but Mantuas law
Is death to any he that utters them
ROMEO
Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness
And fearst to die Famine is in thy cheeks
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes
Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back
The world is not thy friend nor the worlds law
The world affords no law to make thee rich
Then be not poor but break it and take this
APOTHECARY
My poverty but not my will consents
ROMEO
I pay thy poverty and not thy will
APOTHECARY
Put this in any liquid thing you will
And drink it off and if you had the strength
Of twenty men it would despatch you straight
ROMEO
There is thy gold worse poison to mens souls
Doing more murder in this loathsome world
Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell
I sell thee poison thou hast sold me none
Farewell buy food and get thyself in flesh
Come cordial and not poison go with me
To Juliets grave for there must I use thee
Exeunt
SCENE II Friar Lawrences Cell
Enter Friar John
FRIAR JOHN
Holy Franciscan Friar Brother ho
Enter Friar Lawrence
FRIAR LAWRENCE
This same should be the voice of Friar John
Welcome from Mantua What says Romeo
Or if his mind be writ give me his letter
FRIAR JOHN
Going to find a barefoot brother out
One of our order to associate me
Here in this city visiting the sick
And finding him the searchers of the town
Suspecting that we both were in a house
Where the infectious pestilence did reign
Seald up the doors and would not let us forth
So that my speed to Mantua there was stayd
FRIAR LAWRENCE
Who bare my letter then to Romeo
FRIAR JOHN
I could not send ithere it is again
Nor get a messenger to bring it thee
So fearful were they of infection
FRIAR LAWRENCE
Unhappy fortune By my brotherhood
The letter was not nice but full of charge
Of dear import and the neglecting it
May do much danger Friar John go hence
Get me an iron crow and bring it straight
Unto my cell
FRIAR JOHN
Brother Ill go and bring it thee
Exit
FRIAR LAWRENCE
Now must I to the monument alone
Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake
She will beshrew me much that Romeo
Hath had no notice of these accidents
But I will write again to Mantua
And keep her at my cell till Romeo come
Poor living corse closd in a dead mans tomb
Exit
SCENE III A churchyard in it a Monument belonging to the Capulets
Enter Paris and his Page bearing flowers and a torch
PARIS
Give me thy torch boy Hence and stand aloof
Yet put it out for I would not be seen
Under yond yew tree lay thee all along
Holding thy ear close to the hollow ground
So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread
Being loose unfirm with digging up of graves
But thou shalt hear it Whistle then to me
As signal that thou hearst something approach
Give me those flowers Do as I bid thee go
PAGE
Aside I am almost afraid to stand alone
Here in the churchyard yet I will adventure
Retires
PARIS
Sweet flower with flowers thy bridal bed I strew
O woe thy canopy is dust and stones
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew
Or wanting that with tears distilld by moans
The obsequies that I for thee will keep
Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep
The Page whistles
The boy gives warning something doth approach
What cursed foot wanders this way tonight
To cross my obsequies and true loves rite
What with a torch Muffle me night awhile
Retires
Enter Romeo and Balthasar with a torch mattock c
ROMEO
Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron
Hold take this letter early in the morning
See thou deliver it to my lord and father
Give me the light upon thy life I charge thee
Whateer thou hearst or seest stand all aloof
And do not interrupt me in my course
Why I descend into this bed of death
Is partly to behold my ladys face
But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
A precious ring a ring that I must use
In dear employment Therefore hence be gone
But if thou jealous dost return to pry
In what I further shall intend to do
By heaven I will tear thee joint by joint
And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs
The time and my intents are savagewild
More fierce and more inexorable far
Than empty tigers or the roaring sea
BALTHASAR
I will be gone sir and not trouble you
ROMEO
So shalt thou show me friendship Take thou that
Live and be prosperous and farewell good fellow
BALTHASAR
For all this same Ill hide me hereabout
His looks I fear and his intents I doubt
Retires
ROMEO
Thou detestable maw thou womb of death
Gorgd with the dearest morsel of the earth
Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open
Breaking open the door of the monument
And in despite Ill cram thee with more food
PARIS
This is that banishd haughty Montague
That murderd my loves cousinwith which grief
It is supposed the fair creature died
And here is come to do some villainous shame
To the dead bodies I will apprehend him
Advances
Stop thy unhallowd toil vile Montague
Can vengeance be pursud further than death
Condemned villain I do apprehend thee
Obey and go with me for thou must die
ROMEO
I must indeed and therefore came I hither
Good gentle youth tempt not a desperate man
Fly hence and leave me Think upon these gone
Let them affright thee I beseech thee youth
Put not another sin upon my head
By urging me to fury O be gone
By heaven I love thee better than myself
For I come hither armd against myself
Stay not be gone live and hereafter say
A madmans mercy bid thee run away
PARIS
I do defy thy conjuration
And apprehend thee for a felon here
ROMEO
Wilt thou provoke me Then have at thee boy
They fight
PAGE
O lord they fight I will go call the watch
Exit
PARIS
O I am slain Falls If thou be merciful
Open the tomb lay me with Juliet
Dies
ROMEO
In faith I will Let me peruse this face
Mercutios kinsman noble County Paris
What said my man when my betossed soul
Did not attend him as we rode I think
He told me Paris should have married Juliet
Said he not so Or did I dream it so
Or am I mad hearing him talk of Juliet
To think it was so O give me thy hand
One writ with me in sour misfortunes book
Ill bury thee in a triumphant grave
A grave O no a lantern slaughtred youth
For here lies Juliet and her beauty makes
This vault a feasting presence full of light
Death lie thou there by a dead man interrd
Laying Paris in the monument
How oft when men are at the point of death
Have they been merry Which their keepers call
A lightning before death O how may I
Call this a lightning O my love my wife
Death that hath suckd the honey of thy breath
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty
Thou art not conquerd Beautys ensign yet
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks
And deaths pale flag is not advanced there
Tybalt liest thou there in thy bloody sheet
O what more favour can I do to thee
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
To sunder his that was thine enemy
Forgive me cousin Ah dear Juliet
Why art thou yet so fair Shall I believe
That unsubstantial death is amorous
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
Thee here in dark to be his paramour
For fear of that I still will stay with thee
And never from this palace of dim night
Depart again Here here will I remain
With worms that are thy chambermaids O here
Will I set up my everlasting rest
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
From this worldwearied flesh Eyes look your last
Arms take your last embrace And lips O you
The doors of breath seal with a righteous kiss
A dateless bargain to engrossing death
Come bitter conduct come unsavoury guide
Thou desperate pilot now at once run on
The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark
Heres to my love Drinks O true apothecary
Thy drugs are quick Thus with a kiss I die
Dies
Enter at the other end of the Churchyard Friar Lawrence with a
lantern crow and spade
FRIAR LAWRENCE
Saint Francis be my speed How oft tonight
Have my old feet stumbled at graves Whos there
Who is it that consorts so late the dead
BALTHASAR
Heres one a friend and one that knows you well
FRIAR LAWRENCE
Bliss be upon you Tell me good my friend
What torch is yond that vainly lends his light
To grubs and eyeless skulls As I discern
It burneth in the Capels monument
BALTHASAR
It doth so holy sir and theres my master
One that you love
FRIAR LAWRENCE
Who is it
BALTHASAR
Romeo
FRIAR LAWRENCE
How long hath he been there
BALTHASAR
Full half an hour
FRIAR LAWRENCE
Go with me to the vault
BALTHASAR
I dare not sir
My master knows not but I am gone hence
And fearfully did menace me with death
If I did stay to look on his intents
FRIAR LAWRENCE
Stay then Ill go alone Fear comes upon me
O much I fear some ill unlucky thing
BALTHASAR
As I did sleep under this yew tree here
I dreamt my master and another fought
And that my master slew him
FRIAR LAWRENCE
Romeo Advances
Alack alack what blood is this which stains
The stony entrance of this sepulchre
What mean these masterless and gory swords
To lie discolourd by this place of peace
Enters the monument
Romeo O pale Who else What Paris too
And steepd in blood Ah what an unkind hour
Is guilty of this lamentable chance
The lady stirs
Juliet wakes and stirs
JULIET
O comfortable Friar where is my lord
I do remember well where I should be
And there I am Where is my Romeo
Noise within
FRIAR LAWRENCE
I hear some noise Lady come from that nest
Of death contagion and unnatural sleep
A greater power than we can contradict
Hath thwarted our intents Come come away
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead
And Paris too Come Ill dispose of thee
Among a sisterhood of holy nuns
Stay not to question for the watch is coming
Come go good Juliet I dare no longer stay
JULIET
Go get thee hence for I will not away
Exit Friar Lawrence
Whats here A cup closd in my true loves hand
Poison I see hath been his timeless end
O churl Drink all and left no friendly drop
To help me after I will kiss thy lips
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them
To make me die with a restorative
Kisses him
Thy lips are warm
FIRST WATCH
Within Lead boy Which way
JULIET
Yea noise Then Ill be brief O happy dagger
Snatching Romeos dagger
This is thy sheath stabs herself There rest and let me die
Falls on Romeos body and dies
Enter Watch with the Page of Paris
PAGE
This is the place There where the torch doth burn
FIRST WATCH
The ground is bloody Search about the churchyard
Go some of you whoeer you find attach
Exeunt some of the Watch
Pitiful sight Here lies the County slain
And Juliet bleeding warm and newly dead
Who here hath lain this two days buried
Go tell the Prince run to the Capulets
Raise up the Montagues some others search
Exeunt others of the Watch
We see the ground whereon these woes do lie
But the true ground of all these piteous woes
We cannot without circumstance descry
Reenter some of the Watch with Balthasar
SECOND WATCH
Heres Romeos man We found him in the churchyard
FIRST WATCH
Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither
Reenter others of the Watch with Friar Lawrence
THIRD WATCH Here is a Friar that trembles sighs and weeps
We took this mattock and this spade from him
As he was coming from this churchyard side
FIRST WATCH
A great suspicion Stay the Friar too
Enter the Prince and Attendants
PRINCE
What misadventure is so early up
That calls our person from our mornings rest
Enter Capulet Lady Capulet and others
CAPULET
What should it be that they so shriek abroad
LADY CAPULET
O the people in the street cry Romeo
Some Juliet and some Paris and all run
With open outcry toward our monument
PRINCE
What fear is this which startles in our ears
FIRST WATCH
Sovereign here lies the County Paris slain
And Romeo dead and Juliet dead before
Warm and new killd
PRINCE
Search seek and know how this foul murder comes
FIRST WATCH
Here is a Friar and slaughterd Romeos man
With instruments upon them fit to open
These dead mens tombs
CAPULET
O heaven O wife look how our daughter bleeds
This dagger hath mistaen for lo his house
Is empty on the back of Montague
And it missheathed in my daughters bosom
LADY CAPULET
O me This sight of death is as a bell
That warns my old age to a sepulchre
Enter Montague and others
PRINCE
Come Montague for thou art early up
To see thy son and heir more early down
MONTAGUE
Alas my liege my wife is dead tonight
Grief of my sons exile hath stoppd her breath
What further woe conspires against mine age
PRINCE
Look and thou shalt see
MONTAGUE
O thou untaught What manners is in this
To press before thy father to a grave
PRINCE
Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while
Till we can clear these ambiguities
And know their spring their head their true descent
And then will I be general of your woes
And lead you even to death Meantime forbear
And let mischance be slave to patience
Bring forth the parties of suspicion
FRIAR LAWRENCE
I am the greatest able to do least
Yet most suspected as the time and place
Doth make against me of this direful murder
And here I stand both to impeach and purge
Myself condemned and myself excusd
PRINCE
Then say at once what thou dost know in this
FRIAR LAWRENCE
I will be brief for my short date of breath
Is not so long as is a tedious tale
Romeo there dead was husband to that Juliet
And she there dead that Romeos faithful wife
I married them and their stoln marriage day
Was Tybalts doomsday whose untimely death
Banishd the newmade bridegroom from this city
For whom and not for Tybalt Juliet pind
You to remove that siege of grief from her
Betrothd and would have married her perforce
To County Paris Then comes she to me
And with wild looks bid me devise some means
To rid her from this second marriage
Or in my cell there would she kill herself
Then gave I her so tutored by my art
A sleeping potion which so took effect
As I intended for it wrought on her
The form of death Meantime I writ to Romeo
That he should hither come as this dire night
To help to take her from her borrowd grave
Being the time the potions force should cease
But he which bore my letter Friar John
Was stayd by accident and yesternight
Returnd my letter back Then all alone
At the prefixed hour of her waking
Came I to take her from her kindreds vault
Meaning to keep her closely at my cell
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo
But when I came some minute ere the time
Of her awaking here untimely lay
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead
She wakes and I entreated her come forth
And bear this work of heaven with patience
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb
And she too desperate would not go with me
But as it seems did violence on herself
All this I know and to the marriage
Her Nurse is privy And if ought in this
Miscarried by my fault let my old life
Be sacrificd some hour before his time
Unto the rigour of severest law
PRINCE
We still have known thee for a holy man
Wheres Romeos man What can he say to this
BALTHASAR
I brought my master news of Juliets death
And then in post he came from Mantua
To this same place to this same monument
This letter he early bid me give his father
And threatend me with death going in the vault
If I departed not and left him there
PRINCE
Give me the letter I will look on it
Where is the Countys Page that raisd the watch
Sirrah what made your master in this place
PAGE
He came with flowers to strew his ladys grave
And bid me stand aloof and so I did
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb
And by and by my master drew on him
And then I ran away to call the watch
PRINCE
This letter doth make good the Friars words
Their course of love the tidings of her death
And here he writes that he did buy a poison
Of a poor pothecary and therewithal
Came to this vault to die and lie with Juliet
Where be these enemies Capulet Montague
See what a scourge is laid upon your hate
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love
And I for winking at your discords too
Have lost a brace of kinsmen All are punishd
CAPULET
O brother Montague give me thy hand
This is my daughters jointure for no more
Can I demand
MONTAGUE
But I can give thee more
For I will raise her statue in pure gold
That whiles Verona by that name is known
There shall no figure at such rate be set
As that of true and faithful Juliet
CAPULET
As rich shall Romeos by his ladys lie
Poor sacrifices of our enmity
PRINCE
A glooming peace this morning with it brings
The sun for sorrow will not show his head
Go hence to have more talk of these sad things
Some shall be pardond and some punished
For never was a story of more woe
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo
